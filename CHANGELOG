upcoming
 - faster intersections (and) in some cases thanks to @gssiyankai
 - fast range add and remove
 - improved select performance (Bob Potter)
 - serialization and deserialization are faster (deserialization is about 30% less CPU intensive)

version 0.4.9
 - Moved select method in the right interface
 - Fixed possible bug due to arrayOffset
 - Fixed potential issue with trim() on array container
 - Added Flyweight iterators to minimize stress on garbage collector when iterating over many long bitmaps (Borislav Ivanov)

version 0.4.8
 - Fixed poor hash functions
 - Abstraction of common functions across packages

version 0.4.7
 - Fixed silly bug in ImmutableRoaringBitmap.xor

version 0.4.6 
 - Optimized binary search for some common insertion cases
 - Reverse iterators

version 0.4.5
 - Fixed rare cast of iterator overflow (sethp-jive)

version 0.4.4

version 0.4.3 (October 25th, 2014)
 - Fixed rarely occuring bugs having to do with serialization.

version 0.4.2 (October 24th, 2014)
 - Removing unnecessary and buggy toImmutableRoaringBitmap method. Users of previous versions of the library should not use this method.

version 0.4.1 (October 20th, 2014)
 - Semantics of the ImmutableRoaringBitmap modified: the input ByteBuffeer is sliced and thus unchanged

version 0.4.0 (September 23rd, 2014)
 - Format change to reduce Java RAM memory usage

version 0.3.7 (August 12th, 2014)
 - Roaring classes are no longer final
 - Added a few convenience methods for fast aggregation using Iterator inputs

version 0.3.6 (June 13th, 2014)
 - We can now serialize  ImmutableRoaringBitmap.
 - Memory usage of ImmutableRoaringBitmap was reduced.

version 0.3.5 (June 12th, 2014)
  - Added clone method to iterators

version 0.3.4 (May 23rd, 2014)
  - Fixed bug in horizontal_or

version 0.3.3 (May 23rd, 2014)
  - Given ImmutableRoaringBitmap an isEmpty method.
  - optimized horizontal_or

version 0.3.2 (May 21st, 2014)
  - Enabled and fixed iterators. 

version 0.3.1 (May 21st,  2014)
  - Minor correction to JavaDocs

version 0.3.0 (May 20th, 2014)
  - Significant redesign of the classes in the org.roaringbitmap.buffer to reduce heap memory usage
  - Some classes were renamed: MappeableRoaringBitmap is now MutableRoaringBitmap

version 0.2.2  (May 14th, 2014)
  - fixed typo in documentation

version 0.2.1 (May 13th, 2014)
  - adding "isEmpty" methods
  - improved AND aggregate between many bitmaps
  - implemented horizontal (memory conscious) XOR and OR aggregates between many bitmaps

version 0.2.0 (May 7th, 2014)
  - renamed classes in the buffer package to avoid clashes
  - fixed a hashCode bug (Dave Hardcastle)


version 0.1.5 (May 1st, 2014)
  - improved documentation

version 0.1.4 (April 28st, 2014)
  - fixed serialization bug (Bj√∂rn Sperber)

version 0.1.3 (April 21st, 2014)
  - minor cleaning (Rory Graves)

version 0.1.2 (April 15th, 2014)
  - serialization format should not be the same for both org.roaringbitmap.RoaringBitmap
  and org.roaringbitmap.buffer.RoaringBitmap
  - Performance of org.roaringbitmap.buffer.RoaringBitmap should not be on par with
  org.roaringbitmap.RoaringBitmap when the buffer is backed by an array


version 0.1.1 (March 28th, 2014)
  - made serialized format slightly more concise:
    added the serialize/deserialize methods throughout 
    to bypass Java serialization overhead
  - added the serializedSizeInBytes() method for users who 
    wish to query the memory usage

version 0.1.0 (March 21th, 2014)
  - Another fix for serialization
  - Introduction of the org.bitmap.buffer package for memory-mapped bitmaps


version 0.0.2 (March 12th, 2014)
  - Serialization fix (Jon Alvarado)

version 0.0.1 (March 3rd, 2014)
  - First public release
