Real data sets for bitmap testing
packaged by Daniel Lemire on April 3rd 2014

Essentially, each file represents a set of integer values. You can create
bitmaps out of these files.

In many cases, the description of the data sets is provided in our paper:
Samy Chambi, Daniel Lemire, Owen Kaser, Robert Godin, Better bitmap performance with Roaring bitmaps, arXiv:1402.6407.
http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6407

To be used with software published on http://roaringbitmap.org/
(Specifically at http://roaringbitmap.org/RoaringBitmap-0.3.4-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar )




Files starting with the prefix "dimension" were prepared by Xavier Léauté from
a Druid dump.

Some bitsets from a real world example, that can be used to transform them into BitSets

* bitsets_1925630_96.gz  # rows with long[], in this case: long[1925630][96]

Can be deserialized by first reading an int, that is the amout of rows to come (e.g. 1925630 rows)
A row is read by first reading an int, the amount of longs to come (e.g. 96 longs), and then reading those longs.
Used DataInputStream to write this.
