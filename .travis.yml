# oraclejdk10 is depecrated on travis
# oraclejdk12 is apparently not yet available
jdk:
  - openjdk8
  - openjdk10 #capable of compiling but not loading java11 versions of shims, ensures java8 versions get tested
  - openjdk11
  - openjdk12
  - oraclejdk11
  

############
# We still support and test jdk8 for clients, but on travis we no longer build with jkd8, see
# https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/RoaringBitmap/pull/290 for rationale.

# we removed oraclejdk7 as per https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/RoaringBitmap/pull/176#issuecomment-322257170
