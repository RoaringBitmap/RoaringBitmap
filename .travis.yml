# we removed oraclejdk11 and openjdk11 due to https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8212233, and it is not
# clear when this will get fixed with jdk11, so we may have to wait for jdk12, jdk13, and skip jdk11 altogether.

# We still support and test jdk8 for clients, but on travis we no longer build with jkd8, see 
# https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/RoaringBitmap/pull/290 for rationale.

# we removed oraclejdk7 as per https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/RoaringBitmap/pull/176#issuecomment-322257170
